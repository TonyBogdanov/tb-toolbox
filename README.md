A collection of useful tools and snippets.

## Typography

A tool worth noting is the *typography* module packed with dozens of useful [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) mixins for
creating a responsive, baseline-based vertical rithm.

The docs are all found as comments inside the source files, just take look at the `scss/typography` folder and checkout
the [Demo](http://tonybogdanov.github.io/tb-toolbox/demo/typography.html).
